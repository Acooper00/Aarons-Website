				<p>I enjoy many different sports, both casually with my familly and competitvely with a club. These include:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Football</li>
					<li>Waterpolo</li>
					<li>Running (5km)</li>
				</ul>

				<p>Along with my sporting hobbies, I also enjoy music and coding. I have been playing the violin since I was 9 years old and am currently trying to reach grade 4 level. In addition, I am currently taking music as a <a href="#GCSE"><strong>GCSE</strong></a> subject and am enjoying working on our set pieces. I like listening to music in my spare time, and some of my favourite songs are <em>"R U Mine"</em> by Arctic Monkeys, <em>"Wonderwall"</em> by Oasis and <em>"Holiday"</em> by Green Day. You can listen to them here.<br><br></p>

				<p><br>I also like to code, and I have coded scripts such as this webpage in html and css and a script for revision notes in python. In addition, I have created a script to run a robot powered by a Raspberry Pi, which we were making in a club at school. You can see it in action, along with the code, here.<br><br></p>

				<p><br>I am also participating in the Duke Of Edinburgh Bronze Award. I have just completed my assessed expedition in the Mendips, and before that my practice expedition in the Malvern Hills. Here you can see some of the pictures that I took.</p>
